# RealTimeBusTracking

<p> This is the last project that I completed for the course.</p>
<p> The project consists of a map of my home towm Toke in Japan. The line leads all the way in the valley which is located on the other side of town.</p>
<p> It is designed so that the marker on the map moves from the bus terminal to the next if the user clicks on a grey button at the top, which says "Bus stops between Toke station and the valley".</p>
